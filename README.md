# NCSB-Complementation

This repo contains scripts and data used for evaluation of the NCSB complementation method
for semi-deterministic Büchi automata published at [TACAS 2016](http://www.etaps.org/index.php/2016/tacas) as
**Complementing Semi-Deterministic Büchi Automata** by 
*František Blahoudek, Matthias Heizmann, Sven Schewe, Jan Strejček, and Ming-Hsien Tsai*.

If you only want to see how the evaluation of the complementation methods have been done after all automata
were complemented, see the 
[Comparison notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xblahoud/NCSB-Complementation/blob/master/Comparison.ipynb).
If you want to reproduce the results, fork this repo and start with the [Index.ipynb](Index.ipynb) which explains how
all the notebooks work. notebook.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
